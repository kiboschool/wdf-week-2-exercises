# Lecture Schedule
In this exercise, you are expected to create a lecture schedule (time-table) similar to the picture shown. You will majorly practice your understanding of HTML tables.

## Instructions
1. You have been given a style sheet, link this file to the html file to style the table you will create. Feel free to modify the CSS styles to suit your taste.
1. You have been given the `index.html` page that contains not so much. In the `index.html` file:
    - Insert the image `ttms.png`, such that it appears above the table.
    - Type in a pair of table elements.
    - Type in a pair of `<thead>` elements, insert the table header data (Morning, Afternoon and Evening) appropriately into the <thead> element.
    - Type in a pair of `<tbody>` elements, insert the remainder of the table data between the <tbody> elements. Your aim is to generate exactly the table shown.


## Testing
To check that your solution meets the criteria, run `npm run test` in the console. (If you haven't already, you'll need to run `npm install` to install the packages required for testing).

<!-- If your solution has all the required elements it should say something like:

```txt
 
Ran all test suites. 
```-->

If it does not pass one of the tests, you should get some feedback about what is wrong or missing in your solution.

### Valid HTML

The last test is that your HTML follows all of the recommended rules for an HTML document.

[Here is a list](https://html-validate.org/rules/index.html) of all the rules that will be automatically checked. You don't have to memorize this list or check each rule yourself. Instead, if you get feedback that your HTML breaks one of the rules, you can find an explanation of the rule from that list.
