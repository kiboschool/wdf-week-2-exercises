## Instructions
1. You have been given a style sheet, link this file to the html file to style the table you will create. Feel free to modify the CSS styles to suit your taste.
1. You have been given the `index.html` page that contains not so much. In the `index.html` file:
    - Insert the image `ttms.png`, such that it appears above the table.
    - Type in a pair of table elements.
    - Type in a pair of `<thead>` elements, insert the table header data (Morning, Afternoon and Evening) appropriately into the <thead> element.
    - Type in a pair of `<tbody>` elements, insert the remainder of the table data between the <tbody> elements. Your aim is to generate exactly the table shown.
